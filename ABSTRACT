	This project considers a network configuration that includes several layers of protection. It includes a packet filter firewall, ‘demilitarized zone’ or ‘DMZ’. 
  The packet filter is used to prevent low level attacks on systems in the DMZ.
  The systems in the DMZ are those that must be exposed to the outside world. 
  These systems receive most of the outside traffic, so a simple packet filter is used for the sake of efficiency. The systems in the DMZ must be carefully maintained
  by the administrator since they are the most exposed to attack. However, if an attack succeeds on a system in the DMZ, the consequences for the company may be annoying,
  but they will probably not be life threating, since the internal network will be largely unaffected. 
	The architecture implemented in this project is an example of Defense-in-Depth. If one layer of defense is breached, there are more layers that the attacker must overcome.
  If the intruder is skilled enough to break through one level, then he probably has the necessary skills to penetrate other levels. 
  But it’s likely to take him some time to do so and the longer time that the administrator has to detect intruder’s attack in progress,
  the better chance there is of preventing it from ultimately succeeding.
